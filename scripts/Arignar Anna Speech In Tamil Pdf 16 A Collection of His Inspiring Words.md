One of his most memorable speeches was delivered in 1962, when he addressed a massive rally in Chennai (then Madras) to demand the recognition of Tamil as an official language of India. He eloquently argued that Tamil was not just a language, but a rich and ancient civilization that deserved respect and dignity. He also criticized the imposition of Hindi as the sole national language, and warned that it would lead to the disintegration of India.
  
The speech was recorded and broadcasted by Radio Ceylon, and later published as a booklet titled "Arignar Anna Speech in Tamil". It became a bestseller and inspired millions of Tamils to join the DMK and fight for their rights. The speech is still considered as a masterpiece of Tamil rhetoric and political vision.
  
The booklet is now available online as a PDF file, which can be downloaded from various sources. One such source is Scribd, where you can find the link below. The PDF file contains 16 pages of Arignar Anna's speech in Tamil, along with an English translation and some historical notes.
