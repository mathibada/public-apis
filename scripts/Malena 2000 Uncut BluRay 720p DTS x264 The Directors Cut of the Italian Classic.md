Malena 2000 Uncut BluRay 720p DTS x264 is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates Italian cinema, Monica Bellucci's beauty, and Giuseppe Tornatore's storytelling. It is a film that will make you laugh, cry, and fall in love with Malena.
  
Malena is based on a novel by Luciano Vincenzoni, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Giuseppe Tornatore. The film is set in the 1940s in Castelcuto, a fictional town on the coast of Sicily. The film is narrated by Renato Amoroso, a 13-year-old boy who falls in love with Malena at first sight. Malena is a young widow who lives alone and works as a schoolteacher. She is the object of admiration and lust for all the men in town, and the object of envy and hatred for all the women. Malena's beauty and grace make her stand out from the rest of the town, but also make her a target of gossip and slander.
  
Renato follows Malena everywhere she goes, spying on her and fantasizing about her. He also defends her from the insults and attacks of the townspeople, who accuse her of being a prostitute and a traitor. Malena's life becomes more difficult when Italy enters World War II and her husband is reported missing in action. She has to deal with poverty, hunger, loneliness, and violence. She also has to face the hypocrisy and cruelty of the society that judges her without knowing her.
  
The film explores themes such as innocence, love, sexuality, war, morality, and human nature. The film also showcases the stunning cinematography of Lajos Koltai, who captures the beauty and contrast of Sicily. The film also features the haunting music of Ennio Morricone, who composed an original score that reflects Malena's emotions and character.
