## What You Need
 
To decode your radio, you need two dumps, an eeprom dump and a NEC processor dump. Preferably in BIN format. To read the full dump you can use any programmer that supports Nec V850 like Xhorse VVDI Prog, Orange5, UPA-S, Smok[^1^]. If you want to decode you can use rcd310 and rcd510 radio code calculator[^1^]. You can download the calculator from the links below:

## How to Read RCD310/RCD510 NEC & EERPOM
 
Here is a procedure for reading RCD310 radio Nec V850 D70F3358 Processor & 95128 Eeprom with xhorse vvdi prog to for VW SKODA AUDI SEAT. Similar to RCD510[^1^].
 
### Step 1: Read NEC V850 D70703358
 
Connect Nec V850 D70F3356 processor with vvdi prog via mcu3 adapter. vvdi prog wiring has 7 wires, orange5 wiring has 6 wires, 6-wire is enough. In vvdi prog software, select MCU-Renesas V850- D70F3358 and save data[^1^].

There is the wiring for Orange. You need to power the radio itself[^2^].
 
### Step 2: Read eeprom 92128
 
Connect 95128 mcu with vvdi prog via clip adapter. With clip adapter you donât need to unsolder the chip from the board. Select EEPROM-ST-M95128. Read and save eeprom data[^1^].
 
## How to Decode RCD310/RCD510 Radio Code
 
Now upload NEC and eeprom data to radio code calculator to get unlock code. You can get the radio code unlock code without calculator as well. For example, here is the theory:
 
Code location in eeprom â line 000AE0 ( 8Ð 37 8D A4 ). Code = A7D4 x or XXXX. To calculate XXXX â need a dump NEC. Open dump, try the 0xAE0 to 0xD00 fill to 0xFF method, and get the data after âPower onâ[^1^].

## How to Update RCD310/RCD510 Firmware
 
Some users may wonder if there is a firmware update for the RCD310 or RCD510 radio. The answer is not clear, as there are different versions and manufacturers of these radios. Some updates may be available for the MDI component which attaches to the radio, but not for the radio itself. To check if there is an update for your radio, you need to know your real partnumber and HW Revision. Then you can search online for the right update for your RNS.
 
However, updating the firmware may not be easy or safe. You may need special equipment (that only a VW dealer may have) to update the firmware. You may also risk bricking your radio if you use the wrong update or if something goes wrong during the process. Therefore, it is not recommended to update the firmware unless you have a good reason and know what you are doing.
