The flight deck is modeled after the original Boeing 737-200 cockpit and includes all the instruments, switches, knobs and levers that you would find in a real aircraft. You can interact with almost every element of the flight deck and control every aspect of your flight. The product also includes a Sim Ops feature that allows you to customize your flight settings such as fuel load, payload, failures and weather.
